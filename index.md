### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because unit conversions have always been  something that interested me; it's especially interesting seeing it get automated, instead of working the calculations out by hand. Seeing that not matter which numbers I input for milliliter, I will still get a conversion result for: ml, tsp, tbsp, oz, and cups

* Lab 10

   Lab 10, part 2 was also a favorite because it's related to where we live, California, learning about the many counties that are in the state, 58, and the population in each of them which range from 1,235 people in Alpine County to 9,829,544 in Los Angeles county. Being able to write a function that works by being able to search for any of the 58 counties in California is impressive because all you need to do is input the name of the county (and if you input an incorrect county it lists the countries that you can choose from) and the population is automated. 

* Lab 12

   Lab 12, part 2 was an absolute favorite because I was able to visually see a different way of coding, since I was able to create an animation which is more like a flipbook of colors. I have always been fascinated by flip books since even the most basic version of it is able to move and come alive being able to see some sort of story play out. I was able to write a code that makes colors move and change continuously in a loop.
